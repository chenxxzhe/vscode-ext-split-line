## How to use

1. open command pallette, input `split line`
2. hot key: `ctrl + cmd + s` in mac or `ctrl + alt + s` in win, (use default separator, ',')
3. you could configure keybindings `"extension.splitLine"` to change default separator in `args`

## Known Issues

I don't know how to format selection after split.
If you know, please tell me.

## TODO

- [x] format after split
- [ ] test coverage
