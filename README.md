## How to use

1. open command pallette, input `split line`
2. hot key: `ctrl + cmd + s` in mac or `ctrl + alt + s` in win, (use default separator, ',')
3. you could configure keybindings `"extension.splitLine"` to change default separator in `args`
4. space in first or last will convert into a line break.
